Attempts to backport iOS 18 style Calculator Conversion Feature. 

This is still a pre-alpha and currently only supports devices with a similar screen size to iPhone 12's 
You can try on bigger screens though functionality will be broken as the UI is CGRECT 
meaning it's set in a dedicated position with Coordinates and doesn't reposition itself based on screen size.


Reverse Button also is not functional with all Conversions.


Search will be improved.


More conversions coming.

History added for conversions and coming soon for standard calculations
